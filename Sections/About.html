  Come join me on my journey—here’s a bit about myself. I wish I could tell you everything, but we don’t have time for that, so here are a few highlights.

    My name is Carlo, and I’m in a unique season of life: I’m finishing my last year of military service
    at the same time I’m completing a doctorate in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
    I’ve completed multiple deployments around the world while going to school full time and working
    other jobs, and that experience has shaped how I approach both life and technology—with discipline,
    focus, and a willingness to take on hard things.
  </p>

  <p>
    Data and AI fascinate me because they sit at the intersection of structure and possibility.
    There’s something deeply satisfying about turning messy information into clear insight, or watching
    a model slowly get better with each iteration. Outside of my formal coursework, I spend a lot of
    time working through certifications, grinding LeetCode, and building projects that let me experiment
    with new ideas. My research focuses on simulation-to-real transfer in robotics—teaching a robotic arm
    how to manipulate flexible objects in a simulated world so those skills can carry over to the real one.
    Some of that work is still under wraps, but the core of it is about making intelligent systems more
    reliable, robust, and useful beyond the lab.

    As serious as all of that sounds, I’m not someone who sits in front of a screen all day. I love being
    active and outdoors—hiking, tennis, golf, pickleball, and snowboarding are some of my favorite ways to
    reset and think through hard problems in the background. When the weather turns and I’m stuck inside,
    you’ll probably find me playing League of Legends, where strategy, adaptation, and fast decision-making
    feel like a different kind of training. Across everything I do—whether it’s serving, studying, coding,
    or competing—I’m driven by the same goal: to keep learning, to push my limits, and to build AI systems
    that actually make a difference in the real world.
